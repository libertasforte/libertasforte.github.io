<h3>6-13-20</h3>
<p>The inagural cover image. This was the first page I drew of Libertas Forte. I had to just start drawing. But what do I even want to draw? What story could I even be motivated to draw? Maybe I could be motivated if the story was about star-crossed lesbians.</p>
<p>I deprecated this cover image pretty quickly. After hashing out Architect a bit more - the story that these two are from - I don't think it's going to be about star-crossed lesbians anymore. But maybe.</p>
